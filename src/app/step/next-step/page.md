# Next Steps

## Show cases

There are some show cases that you can try out to see the power of WebGPU and WGSL in your browser.

- [Heavy Math Calculation with Web Worker vs Web Assembly (Rust) vs WGSL](/showcases/heavyMathCalculation)

- [Sum Array with Compute Shader](/showcases/sum-array)

## Write your own shader

You can write your own shader in the `editor` and see the result in the preview.

## Learn More

If you want to learn more about WebGPU and WGSL, you can check out the following resources:

1. [Your first WebGPU app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0) - A tutorial that guides you through creating "Game of Life" using WebGPU. It demonstrates both rendering and compute capabilities, which is essential for understanding the power of GPU computing.

2. [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - Provides a step-by-step guide through the world of fragment shaders, which is foundational knowledge of Shader programming.

3. [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) - Although focused on OpenGL, the principles taught here are transferable to WebGPU and can provide a solid background in graphics programming.
